## Any difficulty from attendees obtaining the GitHub Student Developer Pack?

We shared the GitHub Student Developer Pack URL during the event. A few students faced issues with verification due to domain mismatches in their email addresses, but we guided them to the manual verification route.

Many students were interested in tools like **Namecheap, Canva Pro, and MongoDB Atlas**, and some already started using **GitHub Copilot** for their hackathon projects.
